A Pelican Panel egg for hosting Hytale game servers.

## Overview

This egg provides an automated installation and startup configuration for Hytale servers on Pelican Panel. It handles downloading the Hytale server files, setting up the environment, and starting the server with customizable parameters.

**Note**: While designed for Pelican Panel, this egg should work with Pterodactyl Panel as well, though it has not been tested on Pterodactyl.

## Features

- Automated Hytale server installation
- Automatic download of server files from official sources
- Configurable server parameters
- Easy setup and deployment
- Support for custom asset packs
- Backup management
- Multiple authentication modes

## Installation

1. Download the `egg-hytale.json` file from this repository
2. In your Pelican Panel, navigate to **Admin Panel** > **Eggs**
3. Click **Import**
4. Select the downloaded JSON file
5. Configure the egg settings as needed

For Pterodactyl Panel users, the process should be similar, though compatibility is untested.

## Server Configuration

The following variables can be configured:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ASSET_PACK` | Asset pack to use | `Assets.zip` |

| `SERVER_IP` | Server bind IP address | `0.0.0.0` |
| `SERVER_PORT` | Server port | `5520` |


## Scripts

### install.sh

Handles the initial installation of the Hytale server:
- Installs required dependencies (curl, unzip)
- Downloads the Hytale downloader
- Extracts server files
- Downloads the start script from GitHub
- Sets executable permissions
- Runs initial server setup

### start.sh

Manages server startup:
- Verifies Hytale downloader exists
- Sets executable permissions if needed
- Runs the Hytale downloader
- Starts the Hytale server with configured parameters

## Usage

Once installed, simply start the server from your Pelican Panel. The egg will handle:
1. Running the Hytale downloader to fetch the latest server files
